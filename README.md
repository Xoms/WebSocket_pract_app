# WebSocket_pract_app

As an example of usage of websockets  on Node.js + express + socket.io and with webpack, babel, sass

## How to use :

0. Installed Node.js -v 8+ (npm i

1. You need to run a server by command: 
  npm run serve  

2. Open in browser "localhost:9000"

3. Now your are connected via websocket (you can see it in your terminal)))

4. Try to open some new tabs in browser "localhost:9000" (you can see in terminal console.logs about connected user)

### Structure:
#### package.json:
  - npm run serve - will run socket backend on localhost:9000
#### backend
- server's base folder is '/src' (temporary :) )
  + server.js - there he is 
  + const PORT - seems to be a port of localhost where server will be running :)
#### frontend
- frontend - same base '/src' (:flushed O_o)

### Mess & troubles ))))
- Now the backend and frontend are not structured properly  , I'll place them in order in some time :) (it's just a training)
- for now everything is storing without db (idk if ever will be db)


### Used:
- Node.js
- express.js
- socket.io
- webpack 5+
- babel
- ...etc :)
